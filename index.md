## Research 

`2021`
**Dream Story. Urban modernity through Italy and China**  
Department of Regional and Urban Studies (DIST), Polytechnic University of Turin  
*Research assistant. Principal investigator: prof. F. Governa*.  
The project forms part of the activities financed by the PRIN project Rescaling the Belt and Road Initiative: urbanisation processes, innovation patterns and global investments in urban China, and consists in the design and production of an international exhibition and a multi- media catalog on the theme of urban modernities. Drawing on an openly comparative approach to patterns of urbanization, this research explores the emergence of multiple urban moderni- ties by observing them through two apparently unrelated waves of urbanization: that of postwar Italy and that of contemporary China. My involvement in the project consists in supporting the curatorial team by critically selecting case studies and producing both theoretical, archival and field-based research on the driving themes of the exhibition.
