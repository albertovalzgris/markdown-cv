## Currently

**Post-doctoral Research Fellow**  
Interuniversity Department of Regional and Urban Studies and Planning  
Politecnico di Torino  
viale Mattioli 39  
10125 Torino  
Italy

<!--### Specialized in

Extended urbanization, geographies of production, green extractivism, commodity chain analysis, relational ethnography.-->

### Research interests

I am an urban geographer working at the intersection of heterodox economic geography and urban political ecology. My research investigates emerging patterns of urbanization through the shifting geographies of production. As such, my main research interests are rooted in the dynamics of extended urbanization, in the geographies of natural resource extraction and logistical reconfiguration, and in their associated socioecological shifts.

## Research 

`2022-now`
**SUR: città del sud Europa e Global Urbanism**  
Department of Regional and Urban Studies (DIST), Politecnico di Torino  
*Post-doctoral research fellow*. Principal investigator: prof. F. Governa  
This research program, financed by the PRIN project "Rescaling the Belt and Road Initiative: urbanisation processes, innovation patterns and global investments in urban China", seeks to construct a dialogue between the international debate on Global Urbanism and the urban experience of Southern Europe. Global Urbanism emerges as the attempt to build critical urban knowledge starting from the grounded acknowledgment of differences and their continuous mutations. Through this project, we propose to explore the question of a global urban horizon starting from the specificities and differences of various Southern European urban experiences, hence attempting theory building from peripheral loci. In its initial phases, the program will consist in the critical analysis of existing research, in a selection of three case studies and in their subsequent exploration through short fieldwork periods.

`2022-now`
**Umru: Fragments from the Hydrosocial Cycle of Valle Umbra**  
Mahler & LeWitt Studios Residency, Spoleto  
*Geographer in residence*.  
This project is developed in collaboration with visual artist Cecilia Ceccherini and part of Mahler and LeWitt Studios' Materia program. As a collaborative practice bridging geography with the visual arts, the projects maps an embodied and effective exploration of water assemblages of the Valle Umbra, asking how we might reinvent hydrosocial territories and shape them towards a more conscious and environmentally just future. Working in the form of text, sound and textile, the results of this research will be presented in June 2024 as part of Spoleto's Festival dei Due Mondi through an exhibition and an associated independent publication.

`2022`
**I paesaggi operazionali nel Nord Italia. Geografie mobili, strategie spaziali e mappe dinamiche dell’urbanizzazione regionale**  
Department of Architecture and Urban Studies (DAStU), Politecnico di Torino  
*Research consultant*. Principal investigator: prof. S. Armondi  
Which dynamics are reconfiguring those territories of production, circulation and support that exists in relation to large urban concentrations? This project—enabled by funding for original research by the Politecnico di Milano—critically investigates the geographies of operational landscapes in Northern Italian regions with three main goals. Firstly, it aims at tracing emergent economic geographies by updating their interpretive frameworks, cartographic representations and challenging impending urban dynamics. Secondly, it seeks to describe the plurality of policies, actors and strategies that remake urban contexts and territorial configurations; thirdly, it proposes to build evidence and spatial representations that support the activity of planners and policymakers with respect to the shifting dynamics of global production. In its initial phases, the project involves quantitative modeling, spot cartographic analysis and semi-structured interviews as a focus on case studies spanning the width of Northern Italian regions.
<br>

`2021`
**Dream Story. Urban modernity through Italy and China**  
Department of Regional and Urban Studies (DIST), Politecnico di Torino  
*Research assistant*. Principal investigator: prof. F. Governa  
The project forms part of the activities financed by the PRIN project Rescaling the Belt and Road Initiative: urbanisation processes, innovation patterns and global investments in urban China, and consists in the design and production of an international exhibition and a multi- media catalog on the theme of urban modernities. Drawing on an openly comparative approach to patterns of urbanization, this research explores the emergence of multiple urban moderni- ties by observing them through two apparently unrelated waves of urbanization: that of postwar Italy and that of contemporary China. My involvement in the project consists in supporting the curatorial team by critically selecting case studies and producing both theoretical, archival and field-based research on the driving themes of the exhibition.  
<br>

`2017-2021`
**Hinterlands of the green transition. Atacama, lithium and the extended geographies of the zero-emission city**  
Department of Regional and Urban Studies (DIST), Politecnico di Torino  
*Ph.D. candidate*. Tutor: prof. F. Governa  
This doctoral dissertation project explores the dynamics of lithium extraction on the Atacama plateau as an analytical move to understand flows of urban metabolism between cities and hinterlands at the planetary scale. Combining theoretical frameworks from the areas of critical urban studies, economic geography and urban political ecology, the project deepens our understanding of the persisting extractivism of urban green transitions. This argument has been developed through the deployment of ethnographic fieldwork in Argentina and Chile, document and cartographic analysis and visual methodologies. The completion of the project has involved autonomous research design, the organization and fulfillment of international fieldwork and a sustained program of discussion in international conferences and seminaries.  
<br>

`2017`
**Cittadella di Alessandria: Scenari di riuso adattivo**  
Department of Architecture and Design (DAD), Politecnico di Torino  
*Research assistant*. Principal investigator: prof. M. Robiglio  
This research was commissioned by Compagnia di San Paolo with the goal of investigating scenarios of adaptive reuse for the Cittadella di Alessandria, a military complex dating to the second half of the Seventeenth century, beyond its current state of under-utilization. The involvement of my expertise in the project consists in the spatial analysis of existing architectural structures and a qualitative survey around the existing use strategies of the Cittadella as an architectural and environmental complex. The latter has involved the organization and fulfillment of a short ethnographic program that worked as a springboard for designing scenarios of adaptive reuse.
